# Titanic Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset using Python libraries to explore passenger survival patterns and gain insights from the data.

## Overview

The project performs a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic dataset, including:

- Loading and exploring the dataset using **Pandas**
- Handling missing values using statistical techniques
- Creating new features like **HasCabin** and **AgeGroup** for better analysis
- Performing numerical operations such as mean, median, and standard deviation using **NumPy**
- Filtering, grouping, and aggregating data to extract meaningful insights
- Visualizing trends, distributions, and comparisons using **Matplotlib**
- Using **Seaborn** for advanced statistical visualizations like heatmaps and violin plots

This analysis helps understand survival patterns of Titanic passengers and demonstrates core data analysis and visualization skills.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering (HasCabin, AgeGroup)
- Statistical calculations (mean, median, standard deviation)
- Data aggregation and grouping
- Visualizations: bar plots, histograms, heatmaps, violin plots
- Insights into passenger survival patterns

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

## Installation
